# 9GAG Dark Desktop Theme (9GAG DDT)

###A dark theme for 9GAG on desktop (non-mobile) environment

#####This does not apply to or work on 9Chat or 9GAG TV

I have only tested this in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. If anyone wants to test it in another browser, tell me how it goes.

Installation Instructions:
1. To install this theme you need a script manager extention installed in your browser. I Use Tampermonkey in Chrome, GreaseMonkey in Firefox, and ViolentMonkey in Opera.
2. After installing a script manager, find the option in the script manager to add/create a new script to open up the script editor. Below are the different ways to get to the script editors.
  1. TamperMonkey in Google Chrome - there are 2 ways to do this:
    1. From pressing the button added to the address bar and selecting the "Add a New Script" option from the menu.
    2. Going to TamperMonkey's Dashboard and pressing the tab to the left of the installed userscripts tab near the top right of the dashboard.
  2. GreaseMonkey in Mozilla Firefox - there are 2 ways to do this:
    1. From pressing the button added to the address bar and selecting the "New User Script" option from the menu.
    2. Going to GreaseMonkey's Dashboard and clicking on the "New User Script" link near the top left corner of the dashboard.
  3. ViolentMonkey in Opera - Press the button added to the address bar, select the "Manage Scripts" option, and click on the "New" button near the top left of the dashboard.
3. Copy the raw code text from "https://github.com/CivisMiles/9GAG-Dark-Desktop-Theme/raw/master/9GAG_Dark_Desktop_Theme.user.js".
  1. TamperMonkey in Google Chrome & ViolentMonkey in Opera - Paste the code in the text field within the script manager.
